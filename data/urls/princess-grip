The **Princess Grip** is a variant of the double Cup Grip, used either for style or to relieve tension placed on the elbows from Cup Grip.

This grip is commonly used as an alternative grip for upright moves that would otherwise require cup grip. With the Sexy Plié Squat as an example, the Princess Grip is your best friend, as it aids in style and gives you much more control when and where you lower your body into the wide, straddle-squat we all know and love in exotic pole.

**How to Get into Princess Grip**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-handed hold**, your right arm is on top.

For a **left-handed hold**, your left arm is on top.

1. Rest the pole on the same side of your body as the top arm. The pole should fit snugly against your trapezius, which is the “meaty” part of your shoulder. Your head should be to the opposite side of the pole so it can move freely.
2. Reach up high above your head with the hand on the same side as the pole. Grab the pole in a Twisted Grip.
3. Reach up with your opposite hand, bent at the elbow, and grab the pole in a Cup Grip right above your head, near the elbow of your top arm.
4. Your arm should be to move across your head to create a “window” allowing your head to continue moving freely.

**Safety Tips**

* Never hang loosely from the shoulders. Keep your shoulders and back strong in this grip.
* Be careful of reaching too high with the top arm – reaching past your grip may put undue strain on the elbow and should be avoided. Reaching past your grip may happen in situations where you stand on your tip toes to reach higher, then let your weight sink back down into your heels. If you are up on your toes to reach, keep the toes engaged and maintain that height.
