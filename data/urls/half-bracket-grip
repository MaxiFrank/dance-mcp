The **Half-Bracket Grip** is a beginner variant of the Full Bracket Grip. It relies on the Push and Pull method, and it’s important to keep the core tight and shoulders back with this grip, as it’s commonly seen in upright moves, mostly used in spins and tricks that require the body to be at least partially held away from the body.

The main difference between Half-Bracket and Full-Bracket grip is that in Half-Bracket grip, the bottom hand is held out as if you are about to shake someone’s hand. This reduces the strain on the bottom elbow if done properly, with much of the same utility as split grip. While it is considered a way to progress into a full split grip, some pole dancers may prefer half-bracket simply for the ease of use and lesser strain it puts on the body.
