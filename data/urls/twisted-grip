**Also Known As:**

* N/A

The **Twisted Grip** typically refers to the top hand in a move and can be paired with a variety of other grips with the secondary hand.

It is a variation on the typical baseball grip where your fingers are wrapped around each side of the pole. Instead, your shoulder is rotated so you can reach around the pole, grabbing the opposite side. This allows you to face the outside while still securely gripping the pole behind you. Leave enough room for your head to pass through your arms.

**How to Get into Twisted Grip**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-handed hold**, your right hand should be on top.

For a **left-handed hold**, your left hand should be on top.

1. With your top hand, reach high above your head.
2. Reach up as if you are about to take the pole in a Cup Grip, then rotate your shoulder and grip the opposite side of the pole as a cup grip.
3. Your palm should be facing away from your body. If there is pressure on your shoulder or elbow, move your hand higher, away from your body.
4. Place the secondary bottom hand as the move requires. Most often the bottom hand is in the same position as split grip.

**Safety Tips**

* Be aware of the shoulder rotation in this move. This requires good range of motion and strength in the shoulders to be done safely.
* Never hang loosely from the shoulders. The shoulders and upper back should be kept strong and engaged throughout the motion.
