The **Split Grip** is common in a variety of more advanced spins and inverted moves, relying on the *Push and Pull method,* which you can read more about in the sidebar. In this method, you are always Pushing with your bottom hand and Pulling with your top hand, engaging the shoulders, and keeping your core tight. You should not feel any pressure in your lower arm – the top arm should be supporting most of your weight.

If you are inverted, the same principle applies, except your bottom hand is now closest to the ceiling, Pulling, and your top to the floor, Pushing. This is not a grip for beginners, though it is good for beginners to start strengthening their muscles by practicing the push/pull method on the floor.

You can keep your bottom finger (the pointer finger) pointed down and slightly to the outside of the pole to better align your wrist with the pole and help prevent injuries. Pointing straight down is widely taught, but this may not be comfortable to you based on your anatomy, in which case you should wrap your pointer finger partially around the pole.

The closer you are to the pole with this one, the safer it is – there is less chance of straining the bottom arm.
