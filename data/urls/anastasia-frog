The **Anastasia Frog** is a gorgeous and unique shape that is perfect for photoshoots or as an end to a performance. The entrance to this pole shape is relatively easy in terms of many other shapes.

**How to Get Into the Anastasia Frog**

**Move Steps**

1. Start on the pole from a Genie (also known as a Froggy.)
2. Take the top leg off and bring it over your bottom hand.
3. Tuck the crossed foot behind the pole. Point the toes.
4. Turn the chest down to the floor and look away from the pole, extending the neck and pushing the chest out.

**Safety Tips**

* Never let go of the bottom arm in this move. This arm will be holding the majority of your bodyweight and keeping you up on the pole. Letting go of the bottom arm abruptly can cause sudden strain in the top arm, as well as falling.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Losing Leg Grip:** Try to maintain a secure kneepit grip in the bottom leg as your rotate the top leg up and over the bottom arm. Keeping the heel kicked back towards the bum and knee slightly tilted downwards will help you maintain leg grip throughout the motion.
* **Can’t Keep Bodyweight Up:** If you are losing your bodyweight and putting too much strain on the bottom arm, consider thinking about the pole like a sideways seat that you are trying to sit in. Press the bum into the side of the pole and use that to help lift your chest and turn it away from the pole at the last step. This should help you keep your bodyweight up and reduce any strain in the arm.
