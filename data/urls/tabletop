The **Tabletop** is a wonderful move that is popular in many intermediate and advanced transitions. This move opens up a new world of pole dance moves, as being parallel with the floor while already seated in the pole allows for easy mobility both up and down the pole. As a standalone pose, it looks great in photoshoots and can capture an audience’s awe in strong musical pauses during routines.

**How to Perform the Tabletop**

**Move Steps**

1. From your basic pole sit, take both hands down towards your chest, still wrapped around the pole.
2. Lean your chest and head back away from the pole so you are in a plank position.
3. Take the bottom hand underneath you, spread evenly from the body with the upper hand. Your bottom hand should be in pistol grip, so you can push away from the pole and keep your shoulder stabilized.
4. When you are ready, release the top hand, allowing it to come up over your head. Your whole body should be flat, parallel with the ground.

**Safety Tips**

* It is important to keep the shoulders strong here, especially when extending the top arm up above the head and leaning the bodyweight into the bottom arm. Keeping the shoulders away from the ears will help ease any tension in the shoulders and reduce the chances of injury or strain.
* A strong understanding and practice of the Push – Pull method is encouraged for this move to prevent strain in the shoulder, neck, and arm.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Losing Leg Grip:** Remember to stay true to the basic principles taught by the basic pole sit! Keep the thighs tight together and tilt the pelvis. This will help stop you from losing any grip while in this move.
* **Pain in Bottom Shoulder:** If you are experiencing pain or any sort of strain in the bottom shoulder, then your shoulder’s smaller muscles might not be strong enough yet to perform this move. Consider working with the exercises described in the Push Pull method in the sidebar or linked in the pre-requisite moves. Alternatively, you might be leaning into your shoulder. Keep your shoulder away from the neck. The shoulder and back should be strong and engaged throughout this move to prevent any strain. Keep pushing away from the pole with this hand throughout the move.
