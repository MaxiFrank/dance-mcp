The **Pirouette** is an eye-catching transition that you can work into almost any pole dance routine; once you feel comfortable with the basic pirouette, you can start experimenting with variations. Here, we show you how to make one handed variations and two pirouette variations that allow you to change sides smoothly.

**How to Perform These Pirouette Variations**

*Featuring Azu*

**Move Steps (Variation #1)**

**One-Handed Variation**

1. Stand next to the pole and raise up onto your tip-toes.
2. Place your inside hand high above your head and grip the pole. Pivot on your toes and bring your body toward and under your armpit.
   1. Keep your outside hand away from the pole.
3. Simultaneously, extend the fingers of your top hand and let the pole roll over the top of your hand, try to maintain the same distance from the pole to keep your balance. 
   1. Your top hand should maintain contact with the pole. It will “roll” over as you turn your body, allowing you to grab the pole with the palm at the end of the turn.

**Move Steps (Variation #2)**

**Palm-Up Variation**

1. Stand next to the pole and raise up onto your tip-toes.
2. Place your inside hand high up on the pole.
3. Place your outside hand at about head height, palm towards the ceiling and leave it open. Pivot on the toes of your inside leg, and bring your body away from the pole.
4. As your body moves around to the opposite side, your oustide hand will create a “window” for your face. As you move around, let go with that lower, outside hand.
   1. Loosely keep your (higher) inside hand on the pole in this movement. It will “roll” over as your turn your body and allow you to grab the pole again at the end of the turn.

**Move Steps (Variation #3)**

**Outside Hand Variation**

This variation requires you to do a full turn to end on the opposite side of the pole – for example, if you started with your right hand as your inside hand, you will end with your left hand as your inside hand. 

1. Stand next to the pole and raise up onto your tip-toes. Keep your inside hand away from the pole.
2. Place your outside hand at about neck height, palm towards the ceiling and leave it open. Pivot on your toes and bring your body toward and under your armpit.
3. Simultaneously, let the pole roll over the palm of your hand, loosely close the hand for balance and control of your pirouette.
   1. Your hand should maintain contact with the pole. It will “roll” over as you turn your body, allow you to grab the pole at the end of the turn. Readjust your hand height as needed by sliding it along the pole.

**Safety Tips**

* The top hand should maintain contact with the pole at all times to avoid losing balance.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Feet Won’t Pivot:** It’s important to ensure that you are not just on your tip toes, but your weight is firmly on the ball of the foot. By bringing your weight all onto the ball of the foot, you are giving your body the pivot point it needs to move.
