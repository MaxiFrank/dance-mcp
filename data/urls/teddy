1. Standing next to the pole, get into your stronghold grip modifying it so that your outside arm is higher than your forehead. This will allow for better balance and carry your weight as you get into the move.

2. Bring your hips in front of the pole into a waist pocket hold and stand on your tip-toes.

Floor Variation: Alternatively, sink into a squat if you would prefer to be closer to the floor, or if you need to exit the move quickly. Starting higher and sinking into your armpit/bicep allows the pole to get into the right position for a strong grip.

3. Lift the inside leg and grab your inside thigh with your inside hand. At this step, consider if your mobility allows to get into this prep move and whether you can continue on to the next step or continue practicing up to this step for some time more.

4. Assess if your armpit grip feels secure, adjust if needed and bring your outside leg off the floor by bending your knee slightly. At this step, you might be feeling pain; if so, revisit this move up to this step until you feel comfortable to progress.

5. Lift your outside leg forming a V with your legs.

6. Assess if your armpit grip feels secure and, if so, grab your outside leg thigh with your outside hand

7. Continue *breathing*! Return the outside hand to the pole for a safe exit.
