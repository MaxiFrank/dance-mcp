**Also Known As:**

* Reverse Attitude Spin

The **Reverse Sunwheel** is the opposite of the Sunwheel and uses a lot of the same movements as the Back Hook Spin. Mechanically different than the Sunwheel, The Reverse Sunwheel is a wonderful way to get creative with your backwards momentum and explore the feeling of “falling” backwards into a spin.

**How to Perform the Reverse Sunwheel**

**Move Steps**

1. Starting next to the pole, bring your arm around to the opposite side of the pole, bending the elbow, and wrap your hand around the pole. Bring your outside hand high above your head and grab the pole.
2. Step away from the pole to widen the space between your body and the pole.
3. Bring your outside leg out straight to provide momentum.
4. Let your weight fall backwards, leading with the outside leg.
5. As soon as you begin to fall backwards into the spin, bring both legs up and bend them away from the pole.

**Safety Tips**

* When dismounting, always bring your feet back to the floor before letting go with your hands.
* Always keep the shoulders engaged in this position to keep your body away from the pole.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Difficulty Getting the Legs Right:** If you are struggling to achieve the leg position, try it sitting down. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Move whichever leg would be your “outside” or “back” leg to the side of your body. Bend the knee at a 90-degree angle. Bring your “inside” or “front” leg slightly in and bend the knee at a 90-degree angle. This is the position you should be in while in the spin.
* **Can’t Hold the Leg Position:** Consider working on your active hip flexibility to get into the correct leg position easily, and work on conditioning the glutes and lower back if you don’t have the strength to hold the position.
