The **Corkscrew Spin** is a beautiful yet simple intermediate spin that utilizes an anchor grip to keep the body lifted and held away from the pole. This spin is most commonly performed on spin pole for smoother rotation around the pole, and the combination of a bent and straight leg is an interesting addition to any routine.

**How to Perform the Corkscrew Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, place the inside arm on the pole in a forearm grip.
2. The outside hand will come up and over the head in baseball grip, providing a “window” for the head to move freely between the two arms.
3. Step with the inside foot and pull down with the outside arm.
4. Bend the outside knee and bring it up, reaching for the outside elbow. The inside leg should remain back and straight.

**Safety Tips**

* Make sure to push into the pole with your inside arm in anchor grip, pulling down with your top outside arm. This will help keep your body away from the pole and keep your muscles engaged.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Body Crashes into the Pole:** If your body is crashing into the pole, you may need to do further work on the Push – Pull method to strengthen those muscles before attempting
* **Arm Slips Off Pole:** If your inside arm is slipping off the pole as you spin, make sure that you are aligning your body towards the pole, and you are in a proper Anchor grip. If you need to reference how to get into Anchor Grip, you can find that material under the requisite moves.
* **Bent Leg Stays Low:** When you bring your top leg up, try to bring the knee towards your elbow as hard as possible, bringing the hip up as well. Your body will wrap around the pole slightly.
