**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Category:** Grip

**Also Known As:**

* Brace Grip
* Back Grip
* Tuck Grip

The **Tabletop Hold** is not very common as it can be a little tricky to get into, and it is not so comfortable depending on the length of your body. The tabletop plank is a great move for photoshoots but can be difficult where practicality plays a much larger role; however, this grip is necessary in more advanced moves such as Dragontail.

It is very important to keep your shoulders down away from your neck and keep your back and core engaged in this hold. This hold can be tough on the shoulders, requiring a wide range of motion to rotate behind your back, and strength in the minor muscles to hold the position.

**How to Get into the Tabletop Hold**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-handed hold**, your right arm should be on top and the pole to your right side.

For a **left-handed hold**, your left arm should be on top and the pole to your left side.

1. Hold the pole with your top hand, bending the arm to bring the pole into your bicep.
2. Squeeze the pole between your bicep and chest, much like you would in a stronghold.
3. With your outside hand, reach behind your back and grab the pole, palm facing away from you.
4. Keeping the shoulders down and core engaged, lift your legs from the ground or pole slowly, careful to balance your bodyweight evenly.

**Safety Tips**

* Don’t over-extend your shoulder in this move. If you do not have the range of motion to extend the shoulder behind the back and to the pole while remaining strong, then it is important to stop and work on range of motion and shoulder strength before attempting any motion in this position.
* Don’t hang loosely from the shoulders. Keep your shoulders and back strong and engaged in this position at all times.
