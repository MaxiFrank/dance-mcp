1. Get in a forward fold position or downward dog if you require more space

2. Bring one leg up with the shin touching the pole and sliding it up along the pole as far up as is available to you

3. Push on the shin of the leg in contact with the pole. Make sure your hands are strong and straight by your ears.

4. Bring the other leg up bringing the calf to the pole. Your leg position will be similar to the leg grip for the [fireman spin](https://polepedia.com/moves/fireman-spin/) (but upside down)

5. Squeeze your legs and walk your hands closer to the pole. Continue until your torso is very close, or touches the pole. Shimmying the booty while in this position is fun and totally allowed if you’re up for it!

6. Identify which leg is touching the pole on the shin. This leg will move away from the pole -think of it as trying to touch your toes to your head.

7. To exit, return the leg away from the pole to its original position, making contact with the shin.

8. Walk your hands out again until you are in a comfortable distance from the pole to slide your legs down
