These **Heel Clacks** are the quintessential technique to making lots of noise in your floorwork routine. After all, if you’re sporting heels, then it only makes sense to show it off and incorporate it into the choreography. Fun and simple, these are perfect for just about any style that includes heels.

Best of all, you can easily connect these with other floor moves and get creative with the motion. Once you have the *clack* noise down and you feel comfortable playing with the motion, try it interspersed with leg waves, leg clocks, right-side-up, upside-down, and however else you want to clack.
