The **Fan Kick** is a graceful beginner pole trick that engages the whole body. From the hands, which are held in a stronghold grip and keeping your bodyweight up, to the activation of the core that tilts the pelvis up and helps the legs sweep wide, to the legs themselves, which are sweeping around the body with grace and dexterity.

This beginner pole trick is a versatile move, allowing you to add some flare to any pole dance routine, provide a way around the pole, or help you gain momentum for a follow-up trick in more advanced levels.
