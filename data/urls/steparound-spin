The **Steparound Spin**is a fun, versatile spin that is perfect for gathering momentum to transition into other spins and moves, but also looks lovely on its own. This spin can be incorporated into any pole dance routine no matter the level.

With no pre-requisite moves necessary, this is a perfect spin to learn if you are a beginner. The steparound spin is also known as the front spin, basic spin, or around the world. While it can be done on spin pole, it’s best performed on static pole so you have better control over your momentum.
