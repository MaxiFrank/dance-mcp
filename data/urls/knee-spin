The **Knee Spin** is a popular beginner pole spin that brings the body in close to the pole. On spin pole, this spin gathers momentum very quickly. On static, it’s easy to kick into and carry the momentum yourself, giving it a lot of power and easy control. This is a great spin to add a little variety to your pole shapes during a routine, or experiment with controlling your momentum whether you are on spin pole or static pole.

**How to Perform the Knee Spin**

2. Step with the inside foot and swing the outside leg out wide to gather momentum.
3. When your outside leg circles back in, bring both knees to the pole, kissing them together on opposite sides of the pole. Your feet should be pulled up, toward your bum.
