**How to Perform Basic Body Rolls**

**Move Steps**

1. Facing the pole, grasp the pole with both hands in a baseball grip. Stand on your tip toes in a wide stance.
2. Dip the booty backwards as far as you can while keeping a comfortable grip. Keep your chin up towards the pole.
3. Roll your face up the pole as if you are going to lick it (but don’t actually lick it, folks) and arch your back towards the pole.
4. As you come up, pull your chest back, caving the shoulders over the chest.
5. Tuck your pelvis under and drop into a squat position, still on your tip-toes.
6. Press the legs out straight with the booty pushing away from the pole. This puts you in the same position as step number 2.
7. Repeat steps 3 – 6 for as long as desired.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Body Rolls Look Choppy:** If your body rolls are looking clunky or choppy, then make sure to loosen up. Relax! You’ll be surprised how much more flow you have when you’re not trying to hit each key point in a move, but rather trying to piece everything together into a single trick.
