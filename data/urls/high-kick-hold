The **High Kick Hold** is a fun way to add a quick *pop* *up* in any pole dance routine, and gives you the momentum needed to transition into other spinny tricks, or a fun way to showcase a beat in the song right before you move down the pole.

Also known as the straddle pole ab and straddle up, this move is also commonly used as conditioning for inverts. Only requiring a stronghold grip and waist pocket hold, this move is a perfect beginner pole trick for when you want to emphasize a strong point in your routine.

**How to Perform the High Kick Hold**

**Move Steps**

1. Stand on your tip toes and get into a stronghold grip.
2. Bring the booty in front of the pole, legs wide in a straddle, and point through your toes strongly.
3. Pick up the legs, tilting in the pelvis, and bring your legs up as far as you can.
4. Reverse the motion in a controlled manner to come out.

**Safety Tips**

* Don’t hang from the shoulder. Keep your shoulders back and down, away from the neck and ear while you are in your stronghold grip.
* Always bring the feet down firmly to the floor before releasing the stronghold grip.
* Make sure that your stronghold grip is secure before raising your feet off the ground.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Can’t Move Above Waist-Level:** Make sure that you are tucking the tailbone in and up as you move you legs up. Remember that this move also requires a significant amount of core strength to get the legs to chest level and above, so practice and conditioning will make perfect.
* **Legs Always Bend in Straddle:** If you are struggling with bends in the knee as you move your legs up, don’t close them! Keep those legs straddled as much as you can to get the body used to the motion. Additionally, working on your active flexibility will greatly improve your straddle width while keeping your legs straight.
