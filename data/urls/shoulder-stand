The **Shoulder Stand** is a wonderful way to transition around the pole and add a bit of flare to your floorwork either barefoot or in heels.

This trick is beginner-friendly and pole-assisted, meaning you do not need a lot of balance to perform it. The movement will keep you front-facing and your bodyweight centered, allowing you to transition into other floorwork tricks. You do not need a lot of flexibility to perform this move, however, the more active flexibility you have in your middle splits, the showier this trick is.
