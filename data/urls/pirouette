The **Pirouette** is an eye-catching transition that you can work into almost any pole dance routine, whether you’re trying to space out your next pole trick, get into position for an exotic squat in a stylish way, or just continue riding the momentum around the pole.

While this move is the most basic pirouette, once you get comfortable with the movements, you can add your own style, whether it’s a knee out, adding in a hip-sway, figure-four, or a fan – the possibilities are endless.
