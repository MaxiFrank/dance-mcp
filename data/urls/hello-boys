**Hello Boys** is a great move to add a little flare to any pole dance routine. It can be performed quickly to provide a “pop” of motion with the legs, or slowly and sensually, depending on the style you prefer.

Performed from a wrist sit, we recommend that you are comfortable in your pole sits before attempting this move, as it can be uncomfortable. Leg flexibility can be “faked” here, but the more active flexibility you have in your hip flexors and the better your middle splits are, the more impressive this move becomes!
