In the **Thigh Grip**, your ankles should feel like they are glued together and the pole should be pressed tightly between your upper thighs. Like many other body holds, the Thigh Grip is more likely to be found in intermediate and advanced pole dance moves, but it can be seen in beginner moves such as the Ladysit. For added security, point your toes and engage the legs.

**How to Get into the Thigh Grip**

**Move Steps**

1. Situate the pole between your upper thighs.
2. Tightly squeeze the pole between your legs.
3. In upright positions, you can shift your weight to one side or the other to achieve more skin contact.

**Safety Tips**

* Always make sure that you have the correct amount of skin contact before releasing your hands in any move that requires you to.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Not Enough Grip:** If you don’t have enough grip, you might not have enough skin contact on the pole. If you are using metal poles, check to see if the pole is close to any fabric. If so, be sure to roll the fabric up and out of the way.

  If your legs are straight in front of your in a pike, you might find that crossing one ankle over the other helps you achieve a better grip on the pole.

  Lastly, make sure that the pole is tucked into the widest part of the upper thigh, as that will provide the most skin contact. If this is not the case, try tilting your hips to your lower leg as dramatically as possible.
