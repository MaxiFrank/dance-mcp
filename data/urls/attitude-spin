The **Attitude Spin** is a gorgeous beginner pole dance spin that will start teaching you dynamic movements required in pole that are outside of the average range of motion. Once you are familiar with hooking your leg into the pole, the next step is to get familiar with the feeling of bringing the back leg behind your body and holding it there, which will start to test your glutes and how flexible your body is.

**How to Perform the Attitude Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, bring your inside hand up high on the pole, and your outside hand across your chest, in a Half-Bracket grip.
2. Step forward with the inside leg.
3. Swing the outside leg in a wide circle around your body and hook the back of the ankle onto the pole.
4. Bring the other leg back behind you, bending at a 90-degree angle and keep it there for the duration of the spin.

**Safety Tips**

* When you complete this spin, always be sure to step down with both feet before letting go of the pole.
* The half-bracket grip requires you to use the Push Pull method, where you are pushing with the bottom hand and pulling with the top hand. We recommend reading up on the Push Pull method in our additional resources, linked in the sidebar.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Collapsing into the Pole:** When you hook your leg on the pole initially, make sure to maintain contact with the back of the ankle. Don’t let the pole slip towards your calf or into the kneepit. This third point of contact will also help you stay further away from the pole with minimal strength.
* **Back Leg Won’t Stay Up:** If your back leg won’t stay up, you may want to consider working on conditioning for the glute and lower back, as well as flexibility of the front hip flexors. These are all factors in getting the leg up high and keeping it there.
