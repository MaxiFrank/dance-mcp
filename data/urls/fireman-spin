**Also Known As:**

* Fireman’s Spin
* Ankle Spin

The **Fireman Spin** is a wonderful move to get your whole body on the pole, experimenting with how your body moves on the pole while staying close to the ground. Once you master this spin, you can spread the knees far apart from each other for a wide Fireman spin, keeping the ankles together. The only difference here is style, and on spin pole, it will cause you to spin slower.

**How to Perform the Fireman Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, bring your inside hand in high above your head in a baseball grip. Bring your outside hand across your chest and grasp the pole in a baseball grip.
2. Step the inside foot forward, swinging the outside foot in a wide arc around your body. Hook the outside leg on the outside of the pole, with the ankle crossed to the opposite side.
3. Simultaneously, bring your inside foot up, and press it against the backside of the pole, with the ankle crossed to the opposite side. Kiss the knees together.

**Safety Tips**

* Never hang from the shoulder of the top arm. Make sure that you bring the shoulders down and back to keep the shoulders strong and prevent your chest from collapsing into itself.
* Make sure that you have a firm grip on the pole before bringing both feet up at the same time.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Not Enough Momentum:** If you aren’t getting enough momentum with your initial step off, make sure that you are swinging your outside leg around in a wide arc. You may find it beneficial to lead with the hips in this swing, rather than the head or chest.
* **Too Much Spin on Spin Pole:** The closer your body is to the pole on spin, the more spin you will have. Keep your arms strong and don’t let your body collapse into the pole when you bring your feet up. Likewise, if you feel comfortable in the move, you can try widening the knees apart to slow your spin and better control it.
