This **Reverse Foot Mount** is the top half of the hold required for the move Starfish.

This is a popular foot hold in doubles moves as well, sometimes replacing the pole for the arms or legs of your partner.

**How to Get into a Reverse Foot Mount**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-sided** hold, your right foot will be flexed on top.

For a **left-sided** hold, your left foot will be flexed on top.

1. Get the rest of your body in position.
2. Bring your foot around the pole and flex your feet and toes.
3. Press the top of your foot into the pole, and as you feel secure, you can balance your weight out. Your foot should remain locked in this position.

**Safety Tips**

* Don’t let the pole press into your tendons as this can cause cramps and numbness. Instead, try to make sure the whole foot itself is curling around the pole, from the heel to the toes. The ankle should remain strongly flexed.
