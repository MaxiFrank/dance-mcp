The **Carousel Spin** is a gorgeous move that can be performed on either static or spinning pole. In this spin, you will be facing the pole and bringing the knees together and up, holding your body away from the pole.

Because you are holding your entire body weight away from the pole, it is important that you have practiced and understand the concepts of the Push – Pull method required when performing the full bracket grip.

**How to Perform the Carousel Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, take the inside hand high up above your head and grab the pole.
2. Bring the outside hand down low on the pole, into a split grip. Optionally, if it is more comfortable, you can point your bottom pointer finger towards the floor.
3. Step with the inside foot in front of the pole. Swing your outside leg around to gain momentum.
4. Turn towards the pole, utilizing the Push – Pull method to keep your body held away from the pole, bringing the knees up together.

**Safety Tips**

* Ensure that you are secure in your split grip before attempting any moves that require it. The Push – Pull method is an important technique to preventing injury in this position.
* When landing, be sure to step your feet down before letting go of the pole with either hand.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Collapsing into the Pole**: If you find that you can’t hold your bodyweight securely without your bottom arm getting sore, then you should work on strengthening your Push – Pull technique. There is a link in the sidebar for more information on this.   
  If you are collapsing into the pole due to momentum gained by swinging your outside leg, try pushing off with that leg with less force. This will also lessen the strain on your grip. This is particularly important in spin pole, where you also have to balance yourself against the pole’s spin.
* **Not Enough Momentum**: Especially on static pole, it can be tough to gain momentum in this spin. Be sure to execute these movements without pausing between each one to get the most momentum. With enough momentum, the carousel spin becomes much easier to perform. The outside leg will provide the most momentum but stepping with the inside leg first will give you even more momentum if there is no pause between steps. The inside leg step essentially gives you a one-step head-start to gathering momentum.  
  Likewise, turning to face the pole as you swing your outside leg around will allow you to work with the pole’s momentum.
