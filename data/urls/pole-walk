​The **Pole Walk** is a classic way to move around the pole with grace and fluidity. Walking around the pole might seem simple, but adding the finesse of a graceful walk not only helps you train a strong sense of balance and a great toe point, but it provides breathing room in any pole dance routine, giving the audience a moment to look on in awe.

The Pole Walk is an introductory pole trick that every beginner should have in their mental toolbox at the start of their journey, able to be performed on both static and spin poles.

**How to Walk Around the Pole**

**Move Steps**

1. Start with your inside hand holding the pole firmly in a baseball grip high above your head.
2. Push up onto the balls of your feet, engaging the whole leg. Maintain this posture.
3. Shift your weight onto your inside leg. Step with your outside leg, bending the leg, and dragging the toes across the floor gently. Step down with the ball of your foot.
4. Next, shift your weight onto your outside leg. Bend the inside leg and bring it forward, dragging the toes along the ground. Step down with the ball of your foot again.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you’ve walked the desired distance.

**Safety Tips**

* Don’t add pressure to the top of the toes while they are dragging across the floor. Always flip your toes back over to step down on the ball of your foot.
* Always be sure to firmly connect with the floor and shift your weight before stepping with the other foot.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Clunky Steps or Loss of Balance:** When you are ready to switch legs, be sure to shift your weight onto the leg that is firmly on the ground. For instance, if you just stepped forward with your inside foot, you then want to shift all your weight onto your inside leg before taking a step with your outside foot.
* **Tripping Over Your Own Feet:** Be sure to maintain a comfortable distance away from the pole so you don’t feel crowded as you take a step. When dragging your toes, try dragging them in a gentle, outward arc away from your body to help maintain your foot placement.
* **Movement Looks Stiff:** When you shift your weight onto the leg that is firmly on the ground, try tilting your hips heavily downwards to the leg that is stepping forward. Switch with each side. This will give you a lovely hip sway as you walk – and let your shoulders follow your hips’ pull gently, maintaining hand contact with the pole. You can also try dragging your toes with each step in a gentle arc.
