**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Category:** Spin

**Type:**Static Pole, Spin Pole

**Points of Contact:**5

**Also Known As:**

* Tuck Spin

The **Cradle Spin** uses the Push Pull method with the hands spread wide. This is likely the first beginner pole spin you will come across that uses the top of the thighs to such a degree, introducing an applicable way to use the Hip Hold. This spin is a fun way to bring your whole body around the pole and break up the typical motion of other beginner spins.

**How to Perform the Cradle Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, take your outside hand and place it on the pole about nose level, palm facing you.
2. Inside hand is going to move down the pole, palm facing outwards. Your pointer finger should be extended along the pole.
3. Step with the outside foot to gain momentum.
4. Bring the inside leg up, pressing the pole to the outside of the thigh. Roll over to the top of the thigh and bring both knees together.

**Safety Tips**

* Extend the pointer finger of your bottom hand to protect your wrist.
* This move requires the Push Pull method to be successful. If you are not familiar with this grip, we suggest taking a look at the further reading in the sidebar and practicing the moves there before attempting this trick.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Not Enough Momentum:** Stepping with the outside foot is crucial to gaining momentum in this spin, especially on static pole. You should move smoothly from this step into the tuck to get the most benefit from this.
* **Extending the Bottom Finger is Uncomfortable**: This can vary based on anatomy. For some people, it’s better for the pointer finger to be extended but *slightly* wrapped around the pole at the last joint. Give that a try – and remember the rule of thumb: if it feels bad, then something needs to change. You may also be experiencing a lack of finger, hand, and wrist flexibility, especially if you are frequently in front of a computer. Start incorporating finger and wrist stretching into your daily routine and see if this improves the posture of your finger extension.
* **Not Enough Grip**: If you aren’t getting enough “grip” on the pole in this movement, make sure that you are tucking your body in – or curling your bellybutton towards the pole gently – when you bring the knees up to the pole. This will keep your body closer to the pole and make sure you retain as much momentum as possible.
