The **Waist Pocket Hold** is a valuable support for many other holds. Here, the pole will rest in the small of your waist. For more advanced pole dancers, you will use this grip as you lean back into your Chopper or Basic Invert, or to hold your Yogini. Beginner pole dance moves that utilize the waist pocket grip is the High Kick Hold, Backspin, or for Pole Abs conditioning.

The waist is the soft spot right above your hip bones, and it will greatly help you gain leverage as you move with the pole. Men may find this spot trickier to find as the “small of the waist” is less defined. You should be able to catch the pole right above your hips as you lean back easily without supporting your weight with your hands, but you should not be bracing against the hip bones or any ribs.
