These **Hip Dips** are a sensual way to add subtle movement to any performance. Perfect for the beginner pole dancer looking to incorporate more lowflow movements into their pole dance routines. Commonly called Hip Dips, or Hip Sways, this is primarily done behind the pole to showcase the extension of the neck, the rotation of the hips, and extension of the legs. It is best performed on static pole, but it can be done on spin. This is a perfect move to add if you’re looking for an exaggerated, start-stop movement to add to the beat of a song.
