The **Back Ankle Grip** is a useful hold in quite a few inverted moves, particularly when they are extended. Whether you are bendy or bold, chances are, you have used this hold before without ever giving it much thought. It is such a small movement overall, but it can help you push your limits to extend your body away from the pole, giving you beautiful, clean lines.

When doing this hold, if you feel like you are slipping out of it, you have made a case for pointing your toes! Pointing your toes in this hold can push the heel of your foot out into a “hook” and giving your body that extra skin contact it needs to secure everything in place.
