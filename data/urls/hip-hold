The **Hip Hold** is a subtle but crucial hold. In the inverted Jade Split, for example, the hip hold is a main point of contact with the pole, so proper implementation is important. Without rotating the hips, you will struggle to stay on the pole and risk slipping.

You can engage the hips further by arching your back towards the pole, allowing the hips to come forward further as the spine bends. Bringing your outside hand to your bum, as the move allows, can also help move your hips forward and make the connection with the pole.

This grip is subtle, and can be used in a variety of beginner pole moves as well, mainly in sits or spins where the body is pushed forward, in front of the pole.
