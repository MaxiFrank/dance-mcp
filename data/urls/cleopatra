The **Cleopatra** is a versatile, fun transitional floorwork move that enables you to move from one side of the pole to another, switching sides of the body. It’s a showy move that involves a minor amount of flexibility, but the overall movements are simple and uncomplicated.

While this is taught holding onto the pole, it is not strictly necessary to do so. You can do this move standalone on the floor as well. You can also bend whichever knee is on bottom, depending on your stylistic preferences.

**How to Perform the Cleopatra**

**Move Steps**

1. Start in a sitting position with your legs extended and toes pointed.
2. Place your outside forearm onto the ground and lean over on the outside leg and butt cheek.
3. Bring your inside leg up in a straight pike. Optionally, grab the pole.
4. Transfer your weight onto the opposite butt cheek. If you are holding the pole, you can use it to help pull your body around.
5. If you are holding the pole, change hands. As you move to the opposite side, your opposite forearm will come down on the floor, mirroring your starting position. Simultaneously, the opposite leg comes down on the floor, and your starting leg should move up straight in a pike.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Transition is Clunky:** If your transition looks clunky, your weight might be too far back on your bum. Make sure that you are not rolling over your tailbone area, but smoothly over one butt cheek to the other.
* **Bend in Piked Leg:** If you are struggling with a significant bend in your piked leg, consider incorporating more middle-splits training into your flexibility routines, and work on active flexibility in your legs. You’ll find that this makes your pikes much easier to achieve.
