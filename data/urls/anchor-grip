**Difficulty:** Introductory

**Category:** Grip

**Also Known As:**

* Brace Grip

The **Anchor Grip** is a vital hold in pole dancing that is utilized in many different pole dance tricks, climbs, spins, and more. This grip will help anchor your body against the pole so you are not trying to out-muscle any moves. You can think of this grip as the beginning of a fulcrum to help you move up and down the pole. You should be able to completely release your legs from the pole, or bring them up away from the floor in this hold without your body collapsing in.

**How to Get into an Anchor Grip**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-handed hold**, your right arm will be on top.

For a **left-handed hold**, your left arm will be on top.

1. Grab the side of the pole at eye-level with the thumb on the opposite side of your fingers in a crush grip.
2. Bend your arm so the bone in your forearm lines up with the pole. Your elbow should rest on the slight opposite side of the pole from your palm.
3. With your opposite hand, reach high above your head and grab the pole, with the thumb opposite to your fingers in a baseball grip.

**Safety Tips**

* Don’t hang loosely from your shoulders in this move. Your shoulders should be down and back, away from the ear. You should feel strong down your back, lats, and shoulders when you are engaging these muscles.
