**Difficulty:** Introductory

**Category:** Grip

**Also Known As:**

* Strong Grip

**Pre-requisite Moves:**

* N/A

The **Stronghold** **Grip** relies on three main points of contact. The first point of contact is your outside hand, which is in a typical baseball grip on top. The second is your inside hand, gripping the pole below with the pole tucked deep into the armpit. The third point of contact is your inner arm as you squeeze the pole against your body.

Imagine wrapping your arms around the pole and giving it a big ol’ side hug. That’s your stronghold grip!

**How to Get into Stronghold Grip**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-handed hold**, your right hand will be on top, hugging the pole to your body.

For a **left-handed hold**, your left hand will be on top, hugging the pole to your body.

1. Get your hips slightly in front of the pole so you can comfortably lean back, past the pole, and keep it resting on your hip.
2. Take your bottom arm and squeeze the pole between your bicep and the side of your chest.
3. Bend your bottom arm at a 90-degree angle and hold the pole in crush grip, where your thumb is wrapped around the opposite side of the rest of your fingers. Your bottom hand should rest at about eye-level.
4. Take your top hand, reach across your head, and grab the pole in a crush grip, with the thumb wrapped around.
5. Bend your top elbow, causing your top arm’s bicep to cross your neck so you can look over the “window” your arms create.

**Safety Tips**

* Never hang loosely from the arms or shoulders in this hold. Always keep the shoulders and back engaged. The shoulders should be pinched down and back, away from your ears and you should feel strong throughout the whole grip.
