The **Cup Grip** requires finger strength to feel secure. Some moves may require a double-cup grip, and others might require a single hand cup grip; it depends on the move. This grip is most common in intermediate to advanced moves, but it is always a good idea for beginner pole dancers to get a feel for the grip and build up the necessary finger strength.

All fingers should be on the same side of the pole in this grip, while the hands themselves can be positioned either on the same or opposite side of the pole, again, depending on the move. Most of the pressure in this grip should be balanced between the base of your fingers and the top of your palm.
