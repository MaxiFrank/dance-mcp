**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Category:** Grip

**Also Known As:**

* Goofy Grip
* Blood Donor Grip
* Funny Grip
* Dinosaur Grip

The **Funky Grip** earned its name because it is peculiar to look at and keeps you guessing as to what trick is coming next.

Especially in competitions, you can usually tell which invert someone is prepped for by the way they grip the pole: cup grip for shoulder mounts and stronghold for chopper inverts. While this funky grip is a little more challenging than these standard grips, it is a great way to surprise the audience.

**How to Get into the Funky Grip**

**Move Steps**

For a **right-handed hold**, your right arm should be bent on bottom and the pole to your right side.

For a **left-handed hold**, your left arm should be bent on bottom and the pole to your left side.

1. Using your inside hand, press the outside of your elbow to the pole at about chest height.
2. Wrap your inside arm around the front of the pole, pressing the inside of your forearm to the pole.
3. Your inside hand should grab the pole in a normal crush grip, with the wrist rotated so your fingers face you.
4. Alternatively, you can split the fingers between the pole, so the pointer and middle finger are on the opposite side of the pole, and the ring finger and pinkie are on the side nearest to you.
5. With your outside arm, bring it across your body and grip the back of the pole in a cup grip. Alternatively, some people prefer to flip the hand to a crush grip. Your shoulders should be pressing down and back, away from your neck.

**Safety Tips**

* Keep your shoulders strong while performing this move. You will use a lot of the same muscles as a [basic invert](https://polepedia.com/moves/basic-invert/) and many one-handed spins, so a strong foundation in those moves is essential.
* If you feel any pinching, soreness, or tenderness after performing this hold, it is best to discontinue use and work on strengthening the back and shoulder muscles first. Good range of motion in the elbow and shoulder – without hyperextension – will also help prevent injury.
