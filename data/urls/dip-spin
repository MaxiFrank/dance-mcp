The **Dip Spin** is a fun spin that is similar in shape and mechanics to the Steparound spin. The main difference that the Dip Spin showcases is a seated posture as you swing your momentum around the pole. This is an excellent spin to work on to get used to moving your body around the pole while your momentum changes.

Perfect as a beginner pole trick, the Dip Spin only requires a baseball grip to get started, and though it’s not required to know the Steparound Spin previously, it is suggested.

**How to Perform the Dip Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, bring your inside hand high on the pole in a baseball grip. The second hand comes across your chest and grasps the pole, again in a baseball grip.
2. Stand up on your tip-toes and angle your inside foot towards the pole.
3. Dip your front leg down and extend the outside leg straight out to your side. This will feel like a sideways lunge, or a single-leg squat.
4. Pick your outside leg  and let it swing around the pole, carrying your body around. Maintain your squat position around the pole.
5. To come out, step the outside leg down, and straighten both legs.

**Safety Tips**

* Never hang from your elbow on your top arm. Always keep the shoulder engaged.
* Keep one foot on the floor at all times.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Not Enough Momentum:** In the Dip Spin, there are two reasons you might lose momentum. The first is if you haven’t extended your outside leg far enough. Try to think of it like you are leading with that leg, not your body. Keep the rest of your body strong, but relaxed enough to follow the momentum.

  The second reason you might not be getting enough momentum in your Dip spin is if you are caving your chest in. Keep those shoulders strong, and keep a straight posture. If you curl your shoulders in, your chest will cave in – be mindful, keep that from happening, and you’ll have more momentum on your spin.
