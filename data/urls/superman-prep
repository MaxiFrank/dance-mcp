**Preparation Steps**

1. **Does your arm reach back?** Lie belly down on the floor with the pole in your inner thigh grip spot and your arms in a sphinx pose (on your forearms).
2. Engage your glutes and, with the help of one arm, reach your “inner” arm back to grab the pole, thumb facing up, without your body sliding on the floor. 
   1. Do not lose your thigh grip! If you can reach, continue on to the next step!
3. **Can your thighs take it?** With your knees off the floor, hands on the floor and your arms straight and aligned with your shoulders, get the pole in your inner thigh grip spot and lift the feet off the floor to perform a plank.
4. In this plank pose, your whole body is in one straight horizontal line. 
   1. If you are able to hold this position and your thigh grip feels safe, continue on to the next step!
5. **Putting it all together.** Perform the previous step again, getting into a plank with the pole in your thighs but leaving one or two feet on the floor.
6. Reach with one hand behind you to grab the pole, thumb facing up.
7. Once you are secure in your thigh grip and your hand grip, lift the feet off of the floor and lift your arm extended along your ear.
   1. You should be reaching in the same horizontal line as the rest of your body.
8. **To exit,** bring the arm extended along your ear to the floor for support and bring your feet down, then your knees and move away from the pole.

For an extra challenge on your thigh grip, practice getting into your plank from a handstand position by sliding your legs down the pole.

**Safety Tips**

* Do not let your lower back sink in.
* Ensure that both your glutes and mid-back are engaged.
* Keep a micro-bend in your elbow and keep it engaged. You shouldn’t ever *hang* *from your arm.* The arm that reaches back to grab the pole is extended but not hyper-extended.
* Remember to engage by extending forward and up your middle back (push that chest out!) and turn around towards your “inside” hand to decrease the range of motion needed on your chest and shoulder.
* Remember to always be safely on the floor or back on the pole before you ever let go of your grip points.

**Common Mistakes**

* **My Thigh Grip is Sliding!** If you feel that the thigh grip is sliding, you may try crossing one foot on top of the opposite ankle to help you lock the grip. You can also try leaning your hips gently to one side.
