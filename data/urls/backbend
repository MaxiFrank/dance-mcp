**How to Perform a Basic Backbend**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing in front of the pole, wrap your inside hand around the pole in a baseball grip, palm facing you. Your forearm should be wrapped around the pole as well, to help you maintain your balance.
2. Walk your feet out, to the side of the pole, and point your toes.
3. Lean backwards, extending the arm that is on the pole. Simultaneously, reach out with your free hand and look back towards the wall or floor behind you.
4. To come out of the pose, simply reverse the motions, using the hand on the pole to help pull your body up.

**Safety Tips**

* Always maintain your grip on the pole, only releasing when you are safely upright again.
* Stay aware of your back flexibility, and do not push yourself further than you are capable of, especially if this is your first experience with backbends.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Back Arch is Not Dramatic:** Back flexibility is a common goal for many pole dancers, and it requires flexibility training. If you want a more dramatic arch, work on your back flexibility and strength to help you maintain the arch and make it appear more dramatic. You’ll see improvement over time. Additionally, you may find that “leading” with the chest may help you get the most out of your backbend
* **Reach Doesn’t Extend:** If you are having trouble reaching back and making a clean line with your free arm, you may be lacking shoulder flexibility. Focus on shoulder flexibility and conditioning exercises and you’ll see improvement over time.
