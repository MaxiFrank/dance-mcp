* Fireman Spin

The **Wide Fireman** is a new take on the classic Fireman Spin, providing a new shape to the world of beginner pole dance moves. The wide fireman is a simple variant that some might prefer over the basic move, as the knees have more room to move and the hips are kept more open.

**How to Perform a Wide Fireman Spin**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, bring the inside arm up high above the head, and the outside arm across the chest in a Half Bracket grip.
2. Step with the inside foot, then swing the outside foot around and hook with the backside of the ankle.
3. Bring the inside ankle around to the front of the pole and keep the knees spread out wide. The ankles should make an X where they meet on the pole.

**Safety Tips**

* Remember to never hang from the top arm or the shoulder. Always utilize the push – pull method when in a split or half-bracket grip. This will also prevent the chest from collapsing into the pole.
* Always make sure you have a firm grip on the pole before bringing both feet up at the same time.

**Common Mistakes**

* **Not Enough Momentum:**If you are not getting enough momentum to propel your body around the pole, make sure you are stepping your outside leg out in a wide arc. Try to make the motion one smooth, continuous movement, rather than hesitating or taking it in steps. You may also find it beneficial to lead with the hips in the swing, rather than the head or chest.
