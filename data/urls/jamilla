The **Jamilla** is a great way to get into several other inverted moves, opening up a world of alternate inverts and new transitions. Many inverted moves can even be transitioned into directly, so there is no need to perform a leg hook between invert and trick, simplifying combos and shortening routine times.

**How to Perform the Jamilla**

**Move Steps**

1. Standing next to the pole, wrap the outside hand around the pole in front of you at shoulder-height.
2. Bring the inside hand down beside you, wrapping around the pole in a pistol grip.
3. Bring your inside leg up to hip height, pressing the outside of the thigh into the pole.
4. Push with the bottom arm and pull with the top arm to roll over the top of the thigh and bring the outside leg up.
5. Extend both legs for the complete movement.

**Safety Tips**

* Always remember to maintain proper engagement during the push – pull motion. Keeping the shoulders strong will encourage good muscle development and help prevent injuries.
