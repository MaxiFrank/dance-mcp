The **Forearm Grip Shelf** is crucial in many inverted moves, from layback flips to brass monkey, to forearm grip Ayesha and beyond. Most common in inverted moves, it can provide a nice fulcrum for your body, just like anchor grip can in a climb. In other moves, like Janeiro, this top arm can serve well as a shelf to balance your bodyweight.

The bottom arm takes a lesson from [Split Grip](https://polepedia.com/moves/split-grip/), where the pointer finger should be pointed and only slightly wrapped around the pole to provide the best wrist alignment.
